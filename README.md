# Elle's Writer Site
 This is a small static website for a local author.
 
 She was moving from a WordPress host to a non-WordPress situation, but wanted to keep the same layout and look. She provided the images. 
 
 Therefore, this is approximately the Neve theme, cobbled together in regular HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without being WordPress.
 Some of the layout details are also based on some of Kevin Powell's Youtube videos, especially a semi-recent one about responsive websites.
